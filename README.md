# Practicing Polymorphism

This repository is for practicing **Polymorphism** in Java.

It includes multiple small projects where I explore how polymorphism works, including method overriding, dynamic method dispatch, and using parent references to call subclass methods.

I will continue adding more projects here as I learn and apply different polymorphism techniques.
